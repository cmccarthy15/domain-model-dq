# Domain Modelling Challenge DQ

During this DQ, pick one of the below domains and try to sketch out what the domain would look like in as much detail as you can. Cover *at least* those models listed underneath the domain choice. 

While you're planning your projects, your domains will likely look more complex than what we've worked on in prior labs. So, take your hand at planning out domains for applications you may have used before: DoorDash, Ticketmaster, and Venmo. Try to be detialed in what you plan and consider the behaviors the applications have - and whether your domain will allow for accessing the required information easily. 

For instance...
- A DoorDash customer should probably be able to see all restaurants they've ordered from before. 

- A TicketMaster user should probably be able to select an artist as a favorite (this would go beyond the list of models below but DO IT!). 

This repository also includes images that have potential diagrams for each of the models. Yours do not need to match exactly, but consider your differences and update your model diagram if you notice any issues. We don't work at these companies so we don't know their proprietary model domain ðŸ™ƒ **Do not look at the images until after you have a diagram you think is complete and accurate**

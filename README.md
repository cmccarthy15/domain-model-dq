# Domain Modelling Challenge DQ

In preparation for projects and more complex domains

Consider the models listed below but as many join tables or additional models as you see fit

Consider how the models relate to each other and how the user should be able to access info and whether your app allows that. 

IE A DoorDash customer should probably be able to see all restaurants they've ordered from before 

OR A TicketMaster user should probably be able to select an Artist as a favorite (this would go beyond the list of models below but DO IT!)


dont look at the images till the end
